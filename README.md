# TeleTalk
TeleTalk was a Web design project for CS 215 - introduction to Web Development for Rutvik Shah.

TeleTalk has been created as a polling website. It uses php for its backend while html,css and javascript are used as front-ends

You must only view the source code, if you want to run this, then you will need to re-implement the sql server details since the one used in this may no longer be valid in the near future.
